A very minimal anonymous discussion forum that has no usernames, registrations or any other distracting things. All posts are displayed in flat view, but allows replies to specific posts for separate conversations.

Very easy to setup, requires no database engine (uses SQLite which comes with almost all hosting environments) and is written in PHP.
